As we already know : 
> Database : is a collection of data 
> DBMS : is a software to manage our data (CRUD ops)

- *Databases* can be of the following 2 types : 
	- **Relational** (Use tables to store the data)
	- **Non-relational** (Data is not stored in the form of tables)
- Example of relational DB include :
	- *MySQL*
	- *MSSQL*
	- *Oracle*
- Examples of non-relational DB include : 
	- *Mongo DB* 
	- *Redis*

- Hence a **RDBMS** is basically a software which helps us in doing *CRUD* ops on a Relational Database 
- **RDBMS** the data is a structured into **Tables** with predefined relations / connections between them.
- Data manipulation and querying is performed using **Structured Query Language (SQL)**

It is important to know the Following topics of RDBMS:
1. [[Essential Components of Tables]]
2. [[Intension and Extension of Databases]]
3. [[Keys in DBMS]]
