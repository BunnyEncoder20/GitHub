- Used as a software interface between users and data 
- is used to access data, save it, retrieve it, update and manage safely and effectively.
- rules and regulations are crucial to uphold and maintain the database effectively.

### Need of DBMS
- DBMS plays a crucial role for businesses, institutions and organizations of all scales in effectively managing their data - ensuring : 
	- data accuracy 
	- data security 
	- supporting essential decisions making processes 
- It is core of contemporary information systems, facilitating efficient data management and serving as a basis for range of application and services.

### Advantages of DBMS
1. **Data security:** implements security mechanisms that regulate access to sensitive information, safe guarding it from unauthorized access and potential data breaches 
2. **Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:** DBMS remove data redundancy, minimizing storage needs and ensuing consistency through maintenance of a unified version of the data
3. **Data Integrity:** DBMS *guarantees data integrity by enforcing rules and constraints* that prohibit the entry of incorrect or inconsistent data into the DB
4. **Data Scalability:** DBMS can handle large datasets and scale to accommodate increasing amounts of data as a organization grows.
5. **Data Abstraction:** DBMS offers data abstraction, allowing users and applications to interact with the database without needing to understand it's underlying complexities 

### Disadvantages of DBMS
1. **Cost:** Acquiring, deploying and sustaining DBMS software can incur significant costs. Also hardware required for proficient operations of DB also cost a lot
2. **Scale Projects:** When dealing with modest app, minimal DB is required. Adopting a comprehensive DB for the same can lead to avoidable intricacies and additional burdens. In such cases more streamlines data storage solutions are needed.
3. **Vendor Lock-in:** Once you've chosen a specific DBMS, it can be challenging to switch to other software due to differences in data formats, query languages and other technical aspects. This can lead to vender lock in where we are dependent on a particular vendor's product and pricing.
