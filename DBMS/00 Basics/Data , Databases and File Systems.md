## Data

- Data is referred to as the `collection` of raw facts or figures that can be processed to derive meaning or knowledge. 
- It is a collection of information gathered by observations, measurements, research or analysis. 
- In easier terms, data is any fact that can be stored. 
- eg- EXY, 12 etc.

## Information

- Data when processed becomes Information. 
- Information is the knowledge obtained from investigation, study or instruction of data. 
- eg. "Raj" is just data that can be stored and written in a register but when assigned to a man it becomes information i.e. the name of that man.

- Consider the string “orange”. Here it could mean a colour or a fruit. 
- This term **orange** hence becomes data. However, if we say **colour orange** or **fruit orange**, it becomes information. 
- Similarly, “12” could mean age, pocket money or roll number. Hence, this is data. 
- When we say “Roll number 12” it becomes information.

## Databases

- A database is a structured collection of **interrelated data** organized in a way that enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. 
- It is a collection of interrelated data.
	- Can be in the form of a table 
	- Can be of any size

- For example, the image table in the multimedia database would contain all the information about the images like pixels, length, width etc. 
- Similarly, the video table would have features like pixels and video length. Images and Video tables would hence be a part of the multimedia database.
- Similarly, the professor and student table will have a relation with the timetable for class schedules. Hence, they are part of the college database.

- There are several types of Databases discusses in [[Types of Databases]].
## File Systems

- A file system is a structure that an operating system uses to manage and organize files on a storage device (eg:HDD)
- It defines how data is organized, accessed, and stored on the storage device.
- It acts as an interface between user and the data
- **Disadvantages of the file system are:**
	- Data Redundancy
	- Poor memory management 
	- Data inconsistency
	- Data security 

## [[Database Management Systems]] (DBMS)

- A Database Management System is software designed to manage, manipulate, and organize large volumes of data efficiently. 
- It serves as an interface between the database and the users or applications, providing tools for storing, retrieving, updating, and managing data securely.
