- Data = **raw facts** | Abstraction = **hiding**
- DB systems to make them easier to use, hide the complicated stuff that users don't need to worry about 
- This hiding of complex things from users is called **Data Abstraction**.
- Things like data structuring, memory management, indexing, disk saves and location, etc. are hidden from the user

- There are **3 levels** of Abstraction : 
	1. Physical level
	2. Logical level
	3. View level

![[levels_of_data_abstraction.excalidraw]]
- **Physical Level:** 
	- This is the lowest level of abstraction
	- Describes how the data is stored in DB
	- Can get complex DB details at this level
	- Can use optimization techniques (like Binary Trees and searching algorithms) to enhance the performance of the DB here
- **Logical Level**
	- Describes what data is stored in the DB.
- **View Level**
	- This level only describes how the user interacts with the DB system.

> Remember that **attributes** means columns
> And **tuples** means rows in DB terms
