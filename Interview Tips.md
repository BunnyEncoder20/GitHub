	7. Hello. I'm Varun Verma , a Btech Graduate from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. I've specialized in Core Computer Science and recently completed my degree with a 8.7 CGPA. I'm currently working as a intern at L&T Mumbai, where I help in solving problems from multiple domains from testing automation, server side scripting to DevOps. I'm a Full stack developer with experience in both front and backend using the MERN tech stack and proficient in JavaScript. I've familiar with libraries like react and frameworks like Node JS and Express JS. I'm also proficient in python and familiar with Django. My recent project include Quizzie - A Quiz taking web application where we can create and share quizzes. I'm  drawn more towards the backend as I'm more interested in the logical side of things. As your company is looking for a Full stack dev, I feel I will be a excellent fit for your company due to my skill sets and experience. My hobbies include learning how to build computers and servers. I'm very interested in building my own home server for hosting my project's backends, and other services like a NAS (Network attached storage).
2. **3 Strengths and 3 weakness**
	1. For each weakness, prepare a way how you have worked on them and how you have reduced them (procrastination - schedule - 8.7 CGPA, )
		1. *No work-life Balance*  - as pointed out by my mom, I've bad habit of only focusing on work. I do not believe in the concept of work-life balance, as I feel if I want to be one of the best in my field, I need to work much harder for it. I don't feel nice when I'm being out worked. 
		2. *Difficulty Remembering*  - I have a hard time remember stuff, so I tend to forget a lot of the time. I am working on this in multiple ways. I always have my notebook for jotting down stuff, and also have recently started using Obsidian to make my Study notes as it allows for making connection between notes and topics which helps in making links between memories. 
		3. *Was ok with being average*  - For the longest time I thought, being average was ok and didn't push myself and stayed in my comfort zone. However that changed, and I now I started to work hard, due to which I was able to push my CGPA from a 7.0 to a 8.70. Now I refuse and hate being average. I am always pushing to be more. 
	2. For each strength be specific and give examples why those are your strong points ()
		 1. *Very quick learner*  - quick at picking up technologies and learning about software's. At internship, learned how to write automation testing scripts using python and playwright within 2 days and learned Automation Anywhere software in 4 hours and was able to delivery deployable bots by the end of the day (9 bots within the week). 
		2. *Adaptability*  - quickly adapt to the situation and ready to solve any challenge. At intern ships, worked in various domains and solved multiple problems, while also  helping other fellow interns and employees and depts. 
		3. *Critical thinker and Problem Solving*  - I always worked on the problem solving side of things and love to work on logic building. Even at internship, my IS have complimented me on my problem solving abilities and jokes about "Give anything to Varun and he'll find a way".
